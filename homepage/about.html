            <p>What is astronomy ?</p>
        </h3>
        <p>Stargazing (from Ancient Greek ἀστρονομία (astronomía) 'science that concentrates on the laws of the stars') is an inherent science that concentrates on heavenly items and peculiarities. It utilizes math, physical science, and science to make sense of their starting point and advancement. Objects of interest incorporate planets, moons, stars, nebulae, systems, and comets. Pertinent peculiarities incorporate cosmic explosion blasts, gamma beam explodes, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and inestimable microwave foundation radiation. All the more by and large, cosmology concentrates on all that begins past Earth's environment. Cosmology is a part of space science that concentrates on the universe as a whole.[1]

            Stargazing is one of the most seasoned innate sciences.</p><p>The early human advancements in written history mentioned purposeful objective facts of the night sky. These incorporate the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and numerous old native people groups of the Americas. Before, cosmology included disciplines as different as astrometry, divine route, observational stargazing, and the creation of schedules. These days, proficient cosmology is frequently supposed to be equivalent to astrophysics.[2]

            Proficient stargazing is parted into observational and hypothetical branches. Observational cosmology is centered around securing information from perceptions of galactic articles. This information is then dissected utilizing essential standards of physical science. Hypothetical stargazing is arranged toward the advancement of PC or logical models to portray cosmic items and peculiarities. These two fields complete one another. Hypothetical stargazing tries to make sense of observational outcomes and perceptions are utilized to affirm hypothetical outcomes.</p>
